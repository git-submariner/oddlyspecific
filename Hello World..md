This is the open journal by [Pasi](https://santaella.de/), [Jan](https://janeisenbach.de/portfolio) & [Leon](https://leonmonschauer.de/). We document our digital findings and learnings. Maybe it's useful for you!

# Content
Currently we are documenting our work separately. We are working mainly with [[Houdini]], [[Cinema 4D]] & [[Unreal Engine]] and render with [[Redshift]] & [[Octane]]. You can find our seperated Notes in the respective Folders on the left, the hub pages will help you as an index and starting point. 

If you have any questions, feel free to paste them below!
