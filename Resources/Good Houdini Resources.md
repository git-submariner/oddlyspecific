Here you can find some resources that helped me learn and still help me understand all of this better.

## Blog Style Content
- [Entagma](https://entagma.com/) - If you want to understand understanding and also a little bit of [[Houdini]], watch everything they make
- [John Kunz](https://wiki.johnkunz.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)- Crazy talented guy. Great streams 5/5
- [Toadstorm](https://www.toadstorm.com/blog/) - one of the classic people you'll come across when learning. You've maybe even seen [Oil And Water](https://www.toadstorm.com/blog/?p=652) before you even started learning [[Houdini]].
- [Matt's (Tokeru) CG Wiki](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) - The one wiki besides the Houdini Doc

## YouTube Channel Content
- [Bubble Pins](https://www.youtube.com/c/bubblepins) - Just overall good tutorials
- [Entagma's Houdini in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17WRxHRih8&list=PLdFfFRXT0K_gyA6VVBnYVDgAEGYeaJlKN) - Want to get going fast or need to freshen up? [Entagma](https://entagma.com/) got you covered
- [Houdini isn't scary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsv8UGqDibc&list=PLhyeWJ40aDkUDHDOhZQ2UkCfNiQj7hS5W) - I personally didn't watch the tutorials as I already knew the basics on release. But I've heard a lot of good about them

## Discord Channels
- [3d Wizards](https://discord.gg/2kaUU6qQpc) - Nice community if you want to get your questions answered
