...is a project by [Leon Monschauer](https://leonmonschauer.de) and [Pascal Santaella](https://santaella.de) reflecting the feeling with which a dream sometimes leaves us behind. Somehow lost, somehow incomplete - but stunningly beautiful. 


It is an audioreactive piece of the fragments series, about getting in touch with these dreams, with old fragments of memories and enjoying them in their blurry nature.

With its reactiveness to Music and ever changing aesthetics, no viewing will ever be the same. 
And believe us, that so much fun for us, too!

So, enjoy your stay if you see it live, as much as we enjoy it ourselves!
