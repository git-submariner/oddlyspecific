# How does this work?

This website is powered by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). I can highly recommend checking these tools out.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note taking app, that I use for my life in general. [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) basically enables my notes to go online and gives me the possibility to customize everything. Nowadays there are [Notion](https://www.notion.so/de-de), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and many more. I stick to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as it feels very open and community driven. If the service ends, I’ll still have my .md files which I can use just fine. I’m no fan of proprietary file formats.

If you want to get startet with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), you can also check out their [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/cRFFHYye7t)!
