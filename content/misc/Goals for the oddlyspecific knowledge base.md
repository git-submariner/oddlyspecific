## Wait that worked last time I tried it!

This website aims to work comparable to the process of [journaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_therapy), with the main difference of focusing on tech & art problems.

Ideally this website helps people who encounter the same hurdles to achieve their goals faster & learn from our process & mistakes. Sometimes being a (digital) artist requires banging your head against the wall over and over, so be ready for some deep dives!
