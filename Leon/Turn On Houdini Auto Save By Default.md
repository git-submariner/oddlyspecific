# Turn On Houdini Auto Save By Default

You probably know why you are here...

Create a text file, name it 123.py and paste `import hou hou.appendSessionModuleSource('''hou.hscript("autosave on")''')` in the file.

Put it in your `Documents>houdini18.x>scripts` folder (create one if it doesn't exist) and there you go. I've never lost more than 2 minutes of work.

For the lazy: [Download my "123.py"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i08og4vnun0s738/123.py?dl=1) (yes it rhymes on purpose).
